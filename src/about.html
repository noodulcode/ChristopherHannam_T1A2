    <div class="box box-about">I am a dreamer and an ideas person. Not having big enough dreams has never been my problem, knowing which way to go in achieving them has. That’s why I have turned to coding. I believe there are no dreams that are unachievable through coding, technology and collaboration.
    <br><br>Throughout the years I have started many things and finished very few as I don’t think I ever had the right foundation beneath me in terms of education or expertise. That time is over as I become a Junior Full Stack Developer.
    This may currently be a humble website without bells and whistles but beneath the code lay dreams, waiting to explode into reality. <br>Ps the image is not actually the developer.
